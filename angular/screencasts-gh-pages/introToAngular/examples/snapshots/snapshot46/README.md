Creating a custom Angular directive for country entries.

Inspired by:

 * ["Build custom directives with AngularJS" from ng-newsletter](http://www.ng-newsletter.com/posts/directives.html) - This explains the whole story of Angular directives, including the meaning of the `restrict` option, and the `scope: { country: '=' },` syntax.
 * [AngularJS ng-repeat with custom element on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18600710/angularjs-ng-repeat-with-custom-element-inside-a-table-is-rendering-strangely)
 * [Angular home page example "Create Components](http://angularjs.org/)
 * [Angular Docs on Compile](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/compiler)
 * ["Writing Directives" talk by Misko Hevery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqmeI5fZcho&sns=em) - This talk by the creator of Angular elucidates many confusions surrounding Angular directives and how they work.
