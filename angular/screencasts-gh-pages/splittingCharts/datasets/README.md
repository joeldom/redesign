The following tables are derived from the [Pew Research Center Global Religious Landscape data set](https://github.com/curran/data/tree/gh-pages/pew/religion), using this [processing script](https://github.com/curran/data/blob/gh-pages/pew/religion/processed/process.js):

 * populationByCountry2010.csv
 * religionByCountryTop5.csv

The following tables are derived from the [United Nations Population Division](http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DVD/). The data has been preprocessed to extract population of the largest 5 countries for each year from 1950 to 2015, then transformed using this [preprocessing script](https://github.com/curran/data/blob/gh-pages/un/population/2015Extract/process.js)

 * worldPopulation2015.csv
 * worldPopulationByYear.csv
 * populationByCountry2015.csv
