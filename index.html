      <h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

      <p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

      <h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

      <p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

      <h3><a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

      <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

      <h3><a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

      <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

      <h3><a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Support or Contact</h3>

        <strong>Art vs Design:</strong> You can have pretty and ugly art, but design that isn't aesthetically pleasing is deemed "unusable" or bad design. Art can deliberatly be made to create a displeasing reaction to it. This is typicically an undesirable outcome of design.

        <strong>Responsive Design Workflow: Preperation:</strong> Before even opening your design or UX programs, or before thinking about which responsive framework your going to use, before any of that you need to figure out who or what you are designing for. How will this be used? Who will use it? What is message the overall design is going to comunicate? These are less of responsive design question than just general design questions that come into play whether your making a poster, app, chair, car or newsletter.

        <strong>Art vs Design vs Crafts:</strong> For a long time I never understood the terms Arts & Crafts and why the two were bundled together. I always felt Crafts was below an artist to do. Crafting was something art school dropouts and failed designers got into. I guess it would help to first clearly define what the difference is between Art & Design then we can see where "Crafts" fits in.

        <strong>Responsive Design Process : Begining to Code</strong> How you code is almost as important as what order you code in. At this point you have your content architecture and framework all worked out.

        <strong>Information Architecture: Mindmapping the userflow</strong> Deciding early on how the user will find what they are looking for through descriptive navigation and being aware of the content and how it is presented.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>User Experience: Deciding for the User</strong> When you design you are making descions for the people you plan on using it. Making smart decsions is harder than it sounds. With changing user needs, how the content is presented cany change for the same content. Content should dictate the design, not the other way around.

        <strong>User Experience: Doing What is Expected</strong> Doing what is expected is a good thing. Doing what is expected in an unexpected way is what makes the experience interesting. How do you come to design for what the end user expects to see?
      </p>
      <strong>Legacy Content</strong><br>
      <p>
        <strong>Readability: Content, Meet Typograpy</strong> The trouble with content is it can be wordy. Long winded or bloated. It is saying everything it can say all at once. Typography sometimes go for pure elegance and not say anything meaningful. Somewhere inbetween the two there is a happy medium of readabilit that can be visually engauging enough to catch the eye and not strain it.

      <strong>Develop Like a Rockstar</strong><br>
      <strong>Design Like a Rockstar</strong>
      <p>
        <strong>Don't Design To Much</strong> There can be a point where something is over designed. It's at this poin that the design is trying to say more than the content it is supposed to be supporting. Making it pop or pretting it up can reach a point where you are just being a tryhard and not letting it breath.
