## manifest

> a comprehensive idea list for section and themes to have as design doc for content as well as the types of content that will be showcased on the pages.

**E C C O** is a framework for idea and content that find there way into a internet culture that thinks of itself in the digital spectrum of it's own reality. showing the creation of language and imagination alongside technology and information. This shall be the basis for thoughts and ideas to create transformative content with deep linking meta data to create a rich experience that conveys the feelings of words to generate ideas and dynamic data.

#### post types : section types

- dev diary timeline - project idea timeline simliar to **kickstarter** that shows project write ups of the progress with links to the project or out to other `src=`
- github change / work cal - a working `.json` driven work cal that shows posts and other content added on hover with a section below revealing the list of content, this hover effect shows the section but does not disapear when `:focus` has change away.

  - reviews
  - photography sets
  - article write ups - more
  - posts of typography experiments
  - ongoing writing excercises that append past information

#### github revamp styles && styleguide

rework some parts of the styleguide to match the github style on the https://help.github.com/en help side of the site. these use some more modular styles and components within the site. The hope is to have this be even smaller of a footprint on the style changes for the next steps/

- "Be" = 3.5% : 1/2
- "And" = 2.3% : 1/3
- "Of" = 1.9% : 1/4
- "To" = 1.5% : 1/5
- "A" = 1.3% : 1/6
- "In" = 1.1% : 1/7
- "That" = 0.9% : 1/8
- "Have" = 0.8% : 1/9

## Builds

**github calander**

this should be a list iterated dwon through 365 block of time. each block will have a hover state that shows the number of peices `[fragments]` with ech of the fragments there will be a display area that becomes visible by just appearing not scrolling or sliding, but just apearing right beneath the calander.

**europa**

a space rotation animation.

### B E T A F A C E

`betaface`

`HAL > IBM > GZO > JCN`

a data driven ai that was made to save and store a re-tell the stories it has been tought to tell. it sometimes can lie and be michevious. beta-face will be birthed from it's connections and a crude ai will strive to corrupt the information architecture of the being it inhabits.

deep data integration of fragments into parts related to objects into collections

`V277Y084D1-K3CN6T1S`

**concept**

A cultural religion focused on interpreting life inherit mysteries of the mind The idea of a cult leader preaching to it congragats to believe in an ideal and pledge themselves to it while understanding the ubermench or superman from Neizche. similiar to what the Heavens gate cults led everyone to believe they were leaving this place. Jonestown Jim Jones "it is now time for us to meet in another place".

---

**annual report**

this will be a location to show how much data can be accessed through some api magic and displayed and related to one another in a sort of 500ft view of the past year and a sort of way to show off how things have added up.

This shoule be reevaluated to include some datapoints for music and othe rporjects liek on github and as well as other art peices and pictures taken on instagram throughout the year and then filter them into a bucket of an annual report.

This should be a singualr page that shows the amount of data points pulled in and construct a data file to refference in the future. This should be portable and able to be refferenced inside of github as well as sourced and accessed through a API like request.

some ideas for execution:

- bar chart of nights of sleep
- map of trips taken
- chart of food eaten
- number of packages recieved
- music listened to
  - artists
  - songs
  - playlists made
  - new artists vs older replays

**PROCESSING && ELECTRON**
try writing a small text rending app to do some text scrolling on some data files to see how to work with data sets and rendering
[processing.org ~app](https://processing.org/examples/mouse2d.html)

gif animations app => sequencer

designing a CODE AS USUAL: CANCELED

**AWS github site deploy**
work with Sai to set up an _npm_ => _github_ => _aws_

_Firebase_ is another way to handle doing automatic deploys of code to a a server hosting the code.

---

**TIME COMPRESSION**
show a timeline of irrelevant items and how they coincide with the years of their happening. Use deep time principals and github year of work tracker to show time relevance and the illustrate the feeling of time being compressed in our memory. writing a timeline of events that uses the grid similiar to github

---

**NEON GENESIS**

## the hedghogs dilema: as a hedgeho looks for warm with other creatures it tries to get close but ends up hurting them as we want to pull people closer we end up hurting them more than we intend.

## survivor

write a collection of ideas based around if a character was trying to write a book or change the idea of a book or what is a peice of work.

---

## idea for the future

> a paradox idea plan that shows the main character that they will make something in the future. what makes this true is that the item does in fact exist.

---

## click counter deep content web ranking

click counters that tie into a rating sytem of accounts. a sort of social ranking system for accounts that stand behind the content. see. know. feel.

writing beafutiful deep web poetry. define what can be beatuitif in the digital era. content showing deep information reserves that allow thoughts and content to come across and then also be found in the deep web.

this all would involve having a content creating habit tied to a system that is easy to create with. blue print of art describing the thought behind the idea that is now available knowing the shared content that shows how the thinking and cross refference training of the idea comes across. understanding how to deep link inside the ideas in content.

This could be componetized to make the items add to a table that based on their content it will store view and clicks alongside the content in such a way it can compile the ranking on the server at runtime.

## custom content variables

with a custom content variable type, content will be able to have custom planned content replacement and internal linking.

---

## D AE M O N

> creating dif levels of art some begins with leveles of technique, the viewr is shows what the artist wants them to see, tact allows the artist to make areas or concepts of the peice ambiguous and subjective allowing the viewer to imprint their own feelings and thoughts into the peice bringing the artist viewer cycle full circle.

---

## MIRROR WORLD

system boot. run mirror sequence.

an unknown code injection starts to be added all around the world to the databases and systems altering and self-replicating script making algorythms begin adjust and affect the effects of the worlds computer sytems at large. Transmissions begin to appear on the deep web of giant file transfers. The files are first thought to be from a signal in outerspace.

the mirror world begins to bleedthrough to our world. it is first noticed by several individual content creators and average users who begin to find some of the videos and pictures as well as news articles start to forshadow events or replace them entirely. The memories they have and have shared with others have drifted away from what they can recall.

#### project excess

streamlining the design and storage process is going to be crucial. I've combed through a ton of files on the 1903 mac to move over the dropbox for a backup as well as a handoff across different work stations.

combining circuts and glitch with cells and stains to show how the worlds overlap and interplay. the work should be transformative and be streamlined to be uploaded to instagram based on excess templates detailed in the site redesign project on gihub, part of this will be to see how well I can maintain daily posts both in the repo and respective sites.

already missed a day 12.29.19 but have something to post it isnt't perfect but perhaps it shouldnt be

## PARADOX POX

a site virus that shows itself infecting the content of the pages or screens. Screens & Pages should have a distict feel. The infection has a sound as it speeds up. it creates an exponetial counting overflow until it hits an arbitrary length.

## Prophet of Joel

talks of a day where the moon shall cover the sun and day shall turn to night and a new age will begin. With the new age of man knowledge will be dispersed and all shall know.

## Enki Adam Eve

Adam was given instuctions from the lord that he was to live in eternal peace within the garden and Adam asked god for a partner

Adam had been given the fruit that Eve had found and they ate it. And with eating it they then were knowing and they were naked.

## windows 96

an alternate timeline of the world where expeiences and culture are bleeding through into our current instance of life. It tries to show an odd perspective compared to the one we know now. along with having small differences throughout the ARG. I would need to add some logos would be mandela effect styled to be the alternate versions of the ones in the alternate missremebered version of the timeline.
