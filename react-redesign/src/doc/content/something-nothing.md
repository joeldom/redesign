> Ask questions of the reader that start to process of wonder in their mind. They will more likely than not try and find some application of the idea that theyhave pondered in recent or distant memory. Nostolgia is a powerful thing. Tell a story! Have an obvious yet unforseen purpose or destination.

1. Where do the ideas come from? What takes them from some abstract intangible notion to commitment of time and technique?

## ANNECDOTE

> PITCH: Back in, what I am struggling to nail down, 3rd-4th grade we were given the task of drawing something. We were all sat up and down long tables that had evidence of past classes all over them. Be it acrylic paint, marker smudges, gashes, cuts, stains, colors, textures, wear and tear; there was sat some interesting boxes of markers we were to use to color and draw some xeroxed sheet. Similiar to something found in a 'Highlights' magazine. The markers however werne't just your standard 10, 20, 30, 50ct colored markers... No, they were SCENTED! There were a couple "newer" boxes that had all the markers, but most tables had a mix of whatever colors hadn't had the popular colors stolen (this was usually the black marker, which smelled like "Black Licorice"). Of course everyone took them out of the cardboard box and plastic sleeve and opened up the puple "Wow it smells like Grape!" or took out the red "No way, that's Cherry!" and then started to scribble. Trying their best to stay in the lines and make something that would be cool and flashy and of course SMELL wonderful.

> PAYOFF: I don't remeber what I ended up making. I don't have the slightest idea what was on those Xeroxed sheets. I sort of remeber some of the classmates or the particular teacher. But damnit if I don't remeber those markers. For a long time I thought how strange it was to have these chubby scented markers that are gonna have all of these impressionable kids sticking them almost up their noses. Maybe they had their harsh chemicals of dyes and alchohols masked by some fragrent chemical that "very" loosely resembled a candy flavor we had that went with the hue of it. EDIT> Smell is linked very closely to memory. Nostalgia is a powerful too. We create things for the now. We can only tangentially try to insert some meaning or plan of layout or practice of technique. (OMIT> Surely the manufacture of these knew kids would do this...Right? Yeah, they couldn't have not know, much less planned for this.)
