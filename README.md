# MMXVIII REDESIGN

This is the .README file for the UI/UX testing page & test environment for [joeldombek.com](http://www.joeldombek.com) 2016 redesign. This will catalog ideas and issue tracking and live dev environment. The development diary and updated issue tracking can be seen at [MMXVIII](http://joeldom.github.io/redesign/)

### Grey Box

The idea of this is to layout page template elements independent of content and focus on user interaction and organization. The current build [Grey Box](http://joeldom.github.io/redesign/greybox/) will have know todo's and issues detailed along with ideas for future builds.

### Thoughts

The idea behind this is to develop a personal project in a full production style of development and encourage testing at every phase and maintain a consistent and constant update cycle.
